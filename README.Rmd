# rgeopat2

The goal of rgeopat2 is to enhance the functionality of [geoPAT 2.0](http://sil.uc.edu/cms/index.php?id=geopat2).

## Installation

You can install rgeopat2 from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}

## Example

```{r example}
library(rgeopat2)
header_filepath = system.file("rawdata/Augusta2011_grid100.hdr", package="rgeopat2")
my_grid = gpat_gridcreate(header_filepath)
plot(my_grid)
```
